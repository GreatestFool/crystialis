# Roots of Crystialis

_The roots, a place of origin..._

A world of ancient magic, alive and twisting, cursed forms walking the ground at night and crawling through the caverns below. Yours is an origin denied by the very magics of the world and such carries a heavy stigma against it. It may not be able to deny your resurrection, yet, but it carries a heavy price, the loss of items, health and all worldly experience gathered. Flesh does not regenerate and the beings of the world recognize your vile nature and most attack on sight, while others want nothing to do with you but will attack together if you hurt them, and they do not forget. The world hates you and enemies become tougher over time, likewise more dangerous variants are created the longer you stay. Even the landscape twisting itself into one that is more hostile towards your continued survival.

NOTE pack is currently experimental.
